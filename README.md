ABC with pictures and sounds for kids

Live demo: http://abc.neto.li

Currently, this is mainly an animal ABC with more than 40 animal photos and
a couple of animal voices.

All letters and words are read aloud in Lithuanian.
English sounds are lacking, but planned.

It should be easy to contribute content: just look inside data/, images/ and
sounds/ directories.
